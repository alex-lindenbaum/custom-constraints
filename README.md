# Custom Constraints for Succinct Arguments

Rust implementations for R1CS, Plonkish, and [CCS](https://eprint.iacr.org/2023/552), due to Setty et al. 2023. 

This repo is in its initial stage: eventually I will add functionality for generating/verifying SNARKs for CCS. The SNARK in Setty et al. is a generalization of [Spartan](https://eprint.iacr.org/2019/550).
